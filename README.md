# MCP Experiment

MCP servers are all the rage nowadays, so this repo is aiming at exploring the field and see if there is a way to more or less easily make an existing web server "AI" available. I think it would have some values for companies that would not have to re implement all their logic.

This experiment will run in several sessions, each session's details can be found in the docs folder.

## Sessions
